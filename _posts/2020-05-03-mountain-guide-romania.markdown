# Mountain Guide Romania - read before you hire

## The Romanian Carpathians are wild

The Carpathians cover a third of the country’s surface area and are home to numerous wild animals like the brown bear, the wild boar, the chamois and the lynx, to name a few.

With dozens of national parks of pristine beauty and wild nature reserves scattered all over the country, it can be really hard to decide what to visit in your limited time in Romania.

All-in-all, it should be safe enough to go hiking in Romania without a guide if you stay on the marked trails, but if you want to experience the true nature of the Carpathians, you should definitely hire a mountain guide.

A mountain guide will help you make the most of your hiking trip in Romania, taking you safely to the most beautiful places.

## The hiking trails in Romania

Even some of the touristic hiking trails, which are usually well-marked and maintained, are more strenuous and maybe a bit more dangerous compared to the ones in the neighboring countries.

The hiking trails in Romania can become more spectacular, more dangerous, or even more accessible, depending on the season, weather, or snow conditions.

## Wild trekking and rock climbing

However, this article is not about the marked hiking trails in Romania, where we actually encourage you to go without a guide.

This is about something more than hiking. It’s about adventure.

It’s about scrambling, climbing and rappeling, reaching places where only the chamois roam and where special skills and equipment are required.

A mountain guide could take you to places even wilder than you could ever imagine, where you will truly feel the greatness of the mountain.
