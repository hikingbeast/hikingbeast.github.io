## During summer

_During summer the path is visible and does not pose any difficulties, except for the 850 meters elevation gain. All you need is good hiking shoes._

_Be aware that during summer there are several sheepfolds on Baiului mountains. The shepherd's dogs may bark at you in order to alert the shepherd, but they won't bite if you stay calm. Yell for the shepherd if he doesn't call his dogs back in time._
