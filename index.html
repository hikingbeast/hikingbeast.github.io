      <p>Ascend from <strong>Azuga</strong> to <strong>Urechea Peak</strong> (1705 m)  on this 3 hours long moderate hiking trail and you will be rewarded with beautiful views over the <strong>Bucegi Mountains</strong>.</p>

<p>During clear winter days, it seems you are in a fairy tale.</p>

<p>You will start near Azuga at around 900 m altitude and after a 6 km hike you will reach Urechea Peak at 1705 m. If you think it’s too much for you, you can stop at around 1500 m, at the cable car terminal. The views are great from there as well.</p>

<p>During winter, if the path is beaten, it’s an easy hike, otherwise it can be a bit more strenuous, depending on how much snow covers the trail.</p>

<p>There are no sources of water on the trail.</p>

<p>You can park your car for free near Azuga train station. The start of the trail is 1.4 km away from Azuga train station, on DN1 (Srada Victoriei 21), near the first bus station in Azuga coming from Busteni.

<p>At first, you will walk through the forest. It is a pleasant ascend between the tall trees covered in hoar frost.</p>

<p>Ascending towards Cazacu Peak (1753 m)</p>

<p>The Baiului ridge is mild, without much elevation gain. If you still have energy, you can continue on red cross and reach Cazacu Peak (1753 m) in about 50 minutes.</p>

<p>From Cazacu Peak you can descend to Busteni train station (21km in total) or, even more, you can continue hiking on the ridge and descend to Sinaia (26 km in total). If the trail is covered in snow, it’s best to have winter gear like crampons and ice axe.</p>

<h2 id="during-summer">During summer</h2>

<p><em>During summer the path is visible and does not pose any difficulties, except for the 850 meters elevation gain. All you need is good hiking shoes.</em></p>

<p><em>Be aware that during summer there are several sheepfolds on Baiului mountains. The shepherd’s dogs may bark at you in order to alert the shepherd, but they won’t bite if you stay calm. Yell for the shepherd if he doesn’t call his dogs back in time.</em></p>
